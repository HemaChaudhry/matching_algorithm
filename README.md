# matching_algorithm

As a part of our the capstone project at NYCDSA, a non-profit aimed at empowering young women to be leaders in tech approached our team with the following assignment:

They currently have a matching algorithm in places that matches advisee's to advisors based on interests listed in their profile. However, the algorithm fails to match over 20 percent of their users, and furthermore, they are skeptical of how well the algorithm is actually matching advisors and advisees. 

So the task they had for our team was three fold:

1. Identify what qualities made for the best matches between advisors and advisees
2. Create a dashboard that gave an overview of the information in their database
3. Create a new matching algorithm that meets several criteria 
- Waitlisted and VIP users are prioritized
- Advisee's are not matched with advisors from prior matches
- Advisee's are not matched with advisors from the same company from prior matches
- Advisee's are matched by location, then region
- Session topics are assigned such that previous session topics for advisees are not repeated and preferred topic session topic of both advisee's and advisor's are considered
